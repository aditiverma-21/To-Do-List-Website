# To-do-list
This is a responsive To-Do List Website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The application allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently. It supports essential features such as adding tasks, editing them, marking them as complete, and deleting tasks. 

## Features
*Add New Task:* Users can add a task with details like priority and due date using a simple form.
*View/Edit Tasks:* All pending tasks are listed, and users can update the task descriptions directly.
*Mark as Completed:* Tasks can be marked as completed, which visually strikes them out and moves them to the "Completed Tasks" tab.
*Delete Tasks:* Users can delete tasks they no longer need to manage.
*Task Priority and Due Dates:* Optionally assign a priority (Low, Medium, High) and due date to each task for better organization.
*Tab-Based UI:* The interface is split into three tabs—Add Task, View/Edit Tasks, and Completed Tasks—for easy navigation.
*Responsive Design:* The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using flexible CSS design principles.

## Project Structure
*PHP Backend:* Handles form submissions, task additions, updates, deletions, and interaction with the MySQL database.
*MySQL Database:* Stores task information such as task description, priority, due date, and status (completed or not).
*HTML/CSS/JavaScript:* Manages the user interface, including form interactions, task listings, and tab navigation.
